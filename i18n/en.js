    INDEXPOBELSYSTEMTITLE: 'POBEL System',
    INDEXPOBELSYSTEMCONTENT: 'In order to accelerate the development of new technologies, alignment with smart futures and job creation, POBEL was founded with the mission of creating an efficient platform to complete one of the time-consuming and costly components of the machine learning process, namely data labeling. The focus of this platform is on the key role of humans in helping to improve the speed, accuracy and quality of input data to the artificial intelligence algorithms. Humans are the users of the system who can make money by effectively participating in data labeling. However, bringing the behavior of machines closer to human perception requires training in the vast array of data, the labeling of which entails the task of entrusting a large number of users, which is called collecting activity. You can play a useful role in this field while earning money, to contribute to better and more functional learning of artificial intelligence algorithms. Achieving the mission of POBEL is not something that we can do alone and can only be achieved through the participation of a significant number of respectful users.',

    INDEXLABELINGANDDATASETTITLE: 'Labeling and dataset',
    INDEXLABELINGANDDATASETCONTENT: 'Systems need to receive a significant number of images, sounds, and stuff like these to identify and understand emotion so that they can automatically learn to recognize using artificial intelligence models. This learning will be desirable if the relevant examples or so-called input data to machines are of high quality and accuracy. In this regard, labeling refers to the process of marking data in which the accuracy of data input to machines is evaluated by human intelligence and then quality data is used as input for machine learning. Although the purpose of labeling instances is to specify instances, how the labeling is conducted, varies depending on the type of data set (such as visual, textual, audio, and spoken).',

    INDEXLABELINGANDDATASET2CONTENT: 'For instance, in a visual data set, the purpose of each label is to determine whether the displayed image belongs to a specific celebrity, such as "David Beckham". The answer to this question is a tag for the image in question. Also, to tag a data set for emotion analysis, the user must draw a positive or negative inference from the subject after reading a short text such as "This movie is suitable for all ages.".',

In each of these datasets, there are several text, video, and audio queries that users must tag. Depending on the quantity and quality of the registered labels, which are checked by special control approaches, the users\' wallets will be charged online.',

    FAQQ5: 'What should be done in case of being doubtful about correct label for an item?',

    FAQQ11: 'Is the system’s administrator able to disable a user?',
    FAQQ12: 'What are possible options for spending the wallet’s charge?',
    FAQA1: 'The name POBEL system is derived from the two words POD (Pasargad Smart Land Project) and Label (label).',
    FAQA2: 'Yes',
    FAQA3: 'Anyone with a minimum of education who is able to work with a web-based system can register in the system. Also, depending on the level of access, which is mainly based on the degree, specialty or job, eligible individuals can participate in the labeling process and thus make money.',
    FAQA4: 'User performance is evaluated based on the number of registered labels and how well they match the golden data answers. In fact, in each data set, there is a significant amount of golden data whose correct answer is recorded in the system. This golden data is randomly displayed to the user among other data and depending on how correctly it is answered, the users\' financial credit is calculated. Since it is not clear to the user whether the data is golden or not, he/she must answer all the questions taking for granted that the data is golden in order to maximize his/her Rial credit.',
    FAQA5: 'When the user has doubts about the true label of an item, it is recommended that the user opt for the option "skip" (or I do not have any opinion) because in this case the user only loses the points assigned to this particular item and the points earned previously and which can be earned in future will not be lost. However, if the user answers the questions randomly and with little confidence, only minimal credit will be given to the user if it is incorrect.',
    FAQA6: 'For charging the wallet and in proportion to the defined target of each user, two values are considered: the minimum charge and the maximum charge, which are in Rials. The minimum charge is the amount of credit that is allocated to the user for participating in the POBEL system and after answering all the items specified in the relevant target. However, in order to achieve the maximum charge, the user must answer all the golden date in the items that are displayed to him/her correctly. The maximum validity is reduced in proportion to each time the user uses the option "skip", and if you answer a golden item incorrectly, the total score will be invalid and only the minimum charge will be awarded to the user.',
    FAQA7: 'The wallet is fully charged online. However, after a user has answered the number of questions that he has predetermined in his/her target.',
    FAQA8: 'Before entering the labeling section of the data set, each user must specify how many items he/she will answer in a specific time period, such as weekly. Therefore, after completing a target, a new target can be set.',
    FAQA9: 'Specifically, the amount of time a user can devote to labeling over a period of time (for example, weekly) is the most important criterion in selecting a target. In this regard, rough calculations can also be used: for example, by taking 10 seconds to label each item, and taking 20 minutes of rest per hour, 240 questions can be labeled in one hour.',
    FAQA10: 'Yes, there is, but its value is floating and can be updated periodically depending on the labeling rate in the relevant dataset.',
    FAQA11: 'Yes. The system administrator constantly monitors the performance of users, and if a user has a high rate of incorrect answers to the golden data, the relevant user profile in the system will be disabled.',
    FAQA12: 'Due to the capabilities available in the Pasargad Smart Land wallet platform (POD), it is possible to transfer money to a bank account and also to use various services.',
